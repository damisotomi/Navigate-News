# Navigate-News
A  powerful web application that curates different NEWS types from Hacker news external API making it easy for users to access all the NEWS in one place.  

It also exposes an API  for data consumption. 

This web application also runs a scheduled job every  5 minutes to sync the published news in the external API to the DB.

Tested exposed API for data consumption to ensure efficiency using Django Rest Framework.
